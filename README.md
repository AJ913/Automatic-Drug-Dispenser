# Automatic-Drug-Dispenser
In an era of advancing healthcare technology, this project introduces an innovative Automatic Drug Dispenser Machine designed to revolutionize medication management. The system leverages QR code technology and a robust database management system (DBMS) to streamline medication dispensation for patients of all ages. Prior to usage, patients' data is securely stored in the DBMS, allowing for seamless updates and medication tracking
Upon the patient's request, the system generates a QR code representing their medication profile and presents it on a user-friendly tablet interface. Patients can easily select the medicines they require, prioritizing their needs. To enhance accessibility, a coin mechanism is integrated, enabling cost-effective distribution of essential items like masks.
This project focuses on cost-effectiveness and ease of use, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The software architecture is built using Django, Flask, and SQL, while Raspberry Pi and Thonny are employed to integrate hardware components and sensors effectively. Additionally, GSM integration ensures real-time notifications for pharmacists when medication supplies run low, enhancing security and medication availability.
In summary, this Automatic Drug Dispenser Machine redefines medication dispensation, offering an efficient, budget-friendly, and technologically advanced solution that empowers individuals of all ages to manage their health with ease and convenience.
